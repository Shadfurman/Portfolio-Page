		<p>My experience setting up my first local server using Tiny Server. Outlines roadmap for learning web servers

		<p>This is the first local server I setup, that will help me learn about webservers and programming. This server
			is running Tiny Server.</p>

		<p>The goal is to have a job doing eth based smart contract programming by the end of the year.</p>

		<p>The roadmap currently is:
		<ul>
			<li> Refresh on JavaScript </li>
			<li> Familiarize with GIT and GitHub </li>
			<li> Start learning Solidity </li>
			<li> Contribute to projects on GitHub </li>
			<li> Contribute on forums </li>
			<li> Begin looking for jobs </li>
			<li> Finish a medium sized project </li>
		</ul>

		<p> I did run into some hurdles in trying to get SSH running from the phone to administer the page. To keep it
			simple, I used SimpleSSHD.</p>
		<p> Theres usually no password for Android phones. The screenlock isn't a password, and its usually a pin,
			pattern, face or fingerprint ID. </p>
		<p> Instead, SimpleSSHD creates a temporary password, but you don't want to always be looking at the phone to
			login, defeats a lot of the benefit of SSH. So my second issue was setting up authorized keys. With
			authorized keys, no password entry is required. </p>
		<p> SSH uses public/private key pairs to secure the connection, so you want to to generate public/private key
			pairs and then put them in a file AUTHORIZED_KEYS on the host computer, in the directory the SSH server will
			be looking for. For SimpleSSHD that directory is,</p>
	</div>
	<div id="consoleText">/data/data/org.galexander.sshd/files</div>
	<div id="regularText">
		<p> The recommended way of producing public/private keypairs in Windows 10 is ssh-keygen, which before solving
			my first hurdle, I ran into my second.</p>
		<p> There are a lot a complicated options to go with when you create your keys, being a first timer at this, I
			wanted to keep it simple. I just used "ssh-keygen", with no options, so it uses defaults. Generally you want
			to generate these keys in the /.ssh directory which is probably at, </p>
	</div>
	<div id="consoleText">C:\users\%USERNAME%\.ssh\</div>
	<div id="regularText">
		<p>It seems its sometimes an issue, that on PowerShell, ssh-keygen without any options, freezes when it asks you
			for the file pathname and password. I had to force close PowerShell.</p>
		<p> So, the preferred method to get around this, is to use the options modifiers to state the file pathname and
			password in the command, so it never asks you, and so apparently it never freezes. That wasn't the option I
			went with, so I don't have that command for you. I just opened a Cmd Terminal and did it there, reportedly
			after you run it once it fixes the freezing problems with ssh-keygen in PowerShell, but I haven't tried it
			again yet. </p>
		<p> The result is the private key file, <b>id_rsa</b> and the public key file <b>id_rsa.pub</b> you want to get
			the public key file <b>id_rsa.pub</b> into a file <b> AUTHORIZED_KEYS </b> on the host computer.</p>
		<p> I couldn't figure out how to use secure copy <b>scp</b> with the temporary password SimpleSSHD provides. It
			doesn't provide the the temporary password till after you enter the compand, but <b>scp</b> never prompts
			for a password. I couldn't figure out if there was a way to do the authorization first, except for keypairs,
			this is what I did instead. (Copied from somewhere else, I don't remember where.)</p>
		<p> Open the <b>id_rsa.pub</b> file in notepad, or type <b>cat id_rsa.pub</b> in PowerShell, from the ./ssh/
			directory, and <i>copy the contents.</i></p>
		<p> SSH'd into the phone, </p>
	</div>
	<div id="consoleText">
		ssh 192.168.0.x -p 2222
		{username}@192.168.0.x's password:
		user@android:/data/data/org.galexander.sshd/files
	</div>
	<div id="regularText">
		<p> The IP is going to be your phone IP which is right at the top when you start SimpleSSHD, something like
			192.168.0.7 and the {username} is actually your windows username. That threw me off a little, but you
			generally don't have a username on Android, so I guess it defaults to assuming the username is the same.</p>
		<p> By default it should pop you into the directory you want to be in.
			Then,</p>
	</div>
	<div id="consoleText">
		echo "{paste contents of id_rsa.pub here}" > authorized_keys
	</div>
	<div id="regularText">
		<p> Close the connection, now when you SSH in again, it won't ask you for a password, unless you opted for a
			password on the keyfile, in which case, use that password you created, which is of course proper security,
			but you may or may not do as a first timer keeping things simple. </p>

		<p>Hope this helps.</p>
