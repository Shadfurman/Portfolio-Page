                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Proportedly, crypto arbitrage bots are a thing and though competitive, work on occasion. So heres my go at one. I'm still debating on calling it ArbitRaja or ArbitrAvatar. </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Roadmap</h3>
                <p>First I will write the program to monitor a few exchanges for arbitrage opprotunities. 
                    I will keep increasing the number of exchanges until I find its producing occasional opprotunities.</p>
                <p>If its producing, at least an occasional opprotunity, I'll test trasfer funds and make sure thats error free.</p>
                <p>I'll then test flash loans, and make sure that code is error free.</p>
                <p>Finally I'll integrate them all, test each piece as much as possible, implement it and hope for the best and wait for the next opprotunity.</p>

                <h3>Working</h3>
                <p>6/11/23 - Finally got around to doing a little coding. Functions to pull the bid and ask from Kraken and Bitfinex exchanges, wrapped those in a general get_bid_ask function, takes a pair symbol (ie BTCUSD), and the exchange name, returns the highest bid and the lowest ask.</p>
                <p>4/22/23 - At the moment I'm studying the REST APIs, putting together an outline. 
                    Still early on this project, but it will be one of the next ones I start wroking on.</p>
