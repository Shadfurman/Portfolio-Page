                <p>Note: This was written for a Facebook reply on understanding counter arguments to those presented. It
                    ended up being too long for a Facebook post, and not wanting to waste I saved it in my notes until a
                    time when resurection was fitting.</p>

                <p>Web3 technologies and cryptocurrencies offer trustless, transparent, and permissionless systems that
                    have the potential to revolutionize governance and the future of money.</p>
            </div>
            <section>
                <p>I don't consider myself a bitcoin maximalist as I believe in the concept of a diverse market of
                    currencies rather than viewing bitcoin as the ultimate monetary solution. I believe that markets
                    serve as an excellent mechanism for identifying and eliminating products with inherent issues while
                    selecting those that prove to be more effective. Money, in this regard, is no exception and should
                    be subject to market dynamics.</p>

                <p>The distinctive advantage offered by cryptocurrencies lies in their permissionless and uncensorable
                    nature. Unlike traditional financial systems, cryptocurrencies provide individuals with the ability
                    to transact without requiring permission from any central authority. This characteristic ensures
                    that no single entity has control over the flow of funds or can dictate how transactions should be
                    conducted.</p>

                <p>While it is true that governments can impose regulations on cryptocurrencies, potentially hindering
                    their efficiency and ease of use within a specific region, it is important to note that the inherent
                    nature of cryptocurrencies allows for portability across borders. If you possess cryptocurrencies
                    and are able to leave the jurisdiction, you have the ability to securely store your private keys as
                    a word phrase in your mind, rendering them undetectable by anyone else. This feature grants
                    individuals a level of anonymity and control over their funds, making cryptocurrencies a viable
                    option for those seeking financial sovereignty.</p>

                <p>Bitcoin's global reach and decentralized nature make it extremely resistant to being shut down, even
                    under unprecedented global tyranny. In fact, in such a scenario, even traditional safe-havens like
                    gold may not offer any greater security.</p>

                <p>While some refer to bitcoin as "digital gold," it is important to note that it is currently more
                    volatile than gold, largely due to the difference in market capitalization. However,
                    cryptocurrencies do share some similarities with gold, particularly in terms of being a store of
                    value with a set inflation rate.</p>

                <p>However, I believe that people tend to place too much emphasis on simply storing value. This scarcity
                    mindset may limit potential growth. Instead, it would be more beneficial to focus on increasing
                    value.</p>

                <p>Value that remains uninvested holds little worth. Money serves the purpose of purchasing goods and
                    services. Failing to utilize money effectively is akin to having a tool that is used only once.
                    While it is true that some purchases may lead to a decrease in value over time, such as certain
                    consumable items like food, there are also opportunities for value appreciation. This can include
                    investments in education or starting a business. Skills and knowledge cannot be taken away and tend
                    to retain value regardless of location. Essentially, anything that generates value and fulfills the
                    needs and desires of people holds significance.</p>

                <p>The culture of hyper-consumerism often arises due to unsound monetary systems that incentivize
                    short-term thinking and make it difficult to accumulate surplus for investment.</p>

                <p>A sound money system, on the other hand, encourages investment by providing a sense of stability and
                    confidence. While prices may still exhibit volatility, the likelihood of long-term value decrease is
                    reduced, allowing for short-term savings and surplus that can be invested according to one's risk
                    tolerance.</p>

                <p>The debate over whether cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are considered money or currency is complex and
                    involves historical definitions put forth by scholars like Mises or Rothbard. However, as a new
                    technology, cryptocurrencies can be seen as a currency with money-like properties. The specific
                    definition may not be crucial when considering its utility.</p>

                <p>Bitcoin offers greater transportability than gold, making it easier to move across borders and store
                    securely.</p>

                <p>In terms of durability, unless we face an apocalyptic economic collapse, bitcoin generally holds up
                    better than gold as it is not susceptible to physical deterioration. However, in the event of such a
                    collapse, a diverse market of currencies becomes essential, as no single form of money can perfectly
                    satisfy all standards of being a good money.</p>

                <p>Bitcoin also exhibits greater fungibility compared to gold, which can vary in quality and be
                    susceptible to counterfeiting (although counterfeiting gold is still not easy).</p>

                <p>While gold currently exhibits less volatility than bitcoin, as the market capitalization of bitcoin
                    continues to increase, the gap between their volatility levels will likely narrow.</p>

                <p>Although I may have missed some points, it can be concluded that bitcoin largely meets the
                    requirements for being considered a good form of money. However, it is worth noting that even gold,
                    which has been historically used as money, proved insufficient in protecting us from the rise of
                    fiat currencies. Hence, we must acknowledge the need for a diverse range of currencies to address
                    the limitations of any single monetary solution.</p>

                <p>For the arguments on intrinsic value, this is a bad Austrian argument and Austrians should know
                    better (Peter). The contention revolves around the concept of intrinsic value, which is often
                    invoked erroneously. Intrinsic value suggests that something possesses inherent or objective worth,
                    independent of subjective valuations. However, value itself is inherently subjective, as espoused by
                    the Austrian School of Economics. According to this perspective, value is not something inherent to
                    an object or asset; rather, it is derived from the subjective preferences and assessments of
                    individuals. Therefore, the notion of intrinsic value is flawed and runs counter to the fundamental
                    principles of Austrian economics. It is important to recognize that value is not an objective
                    property of an object; rather, it emerges from the interactions and subjective judgments of
                    individuals. A more charitable interpretation of the intrinsic value argument could be that it
                    pertains to intrinsic utility. While physical properties may grant certain objects innate
                    capabilities, the subjective value attributed to that utility still remains contingent upon
                    individual perceptions and preferences.</p>

                <p>For example, a cellphone has significant utility, but the Amish community and many others may not
                    value it highly, and its value may diminish over time. Similarly, Bitcoin possesses intrinsic
                    utility as an intermediary exchange of value.</p>

                <p>The claim that Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme is simply unfounded. A pyramid scheme refers to a
                    fraudulent system where the sole product being sold is the promise of monetary returns, with no
                    other tangible product. However, the perceived value and utility of Bitcoin are subjective and can
                    vary among individuals. While some people may use it for speculation or as a store of value,
                    especially in the current market, the primary utility of money is its ability to facilitate the
                    exchange of value, a role that Bitcoin fulfills. Arguments branding Bitcoin as a pyramid scheme,
                    even though they do not align with the actual definition of a pyramid scheme, could be applied to
                    any market.</p>

                <p>The price of all assets is determined by what people are willing to pay for them. Just because gold
                    can be used for plating conductors does not mean that individuals value gold primarily for that
                    purpose, and they are unlikely to do so. If someone owns gold, they will most likely sell it for
                    something else since gold cannot be consumed as food or used directly for shelter or defense. The
                    price obtained for gold is based on the fact that there is someone on the other end of the
                    transaction who deems it valuable and is willing to pay for it.</p>

                <p>This is how markets function. The argument of a pyramid scheme is inherently anti-market, as it fails
                    to recognize the voluntary exchange of value that occurs based on subjective preferences and
                    utility.</p>

                <p>People often raise concerns about the potential hacking of Bitcoin. While it is true that hackers can
                    target Bitcoin, it is important to note that securing well-protected Bitcoin is considerably more
                    challenging than stealing well-secured gold. This perspective may be difficult for some to grasp due
                    to a lack of understanding.</p>

                <p>It is worth highlighting that the majority of stolen Bitcoin has been pilfered from insecure
                    custodians, particularly crypto banks. These entities do not represent the inherent security of
                    Bitcoin itself. It is essential to differentiate between custodians and the technology of Bitcoin.
                    Furthermore, while governments have a history of confiscating gold, even in the United States, where
                    citizens were required to surrender their gold coinage in exchange for dollars, one can conceal
                    Bitcoin even more easily. The technology behind Bitcoin itself is highly resistant to hacking
                    attempts, even by governments equipped with the most powerful supercomputers.</p>

                <p>Some individuals raise concerns about future technologies, such as quantum computing, in an attempt
                    to argue that Bitcoin is or will become insecure. However, it is important to note that these
                    technologies do not currently possess the capabilities being attributed to them. Additionally,
                    quantum-resistant encryption already exists, although it may be less efficient and costlier to
                    implement at this time. Nevertheless, there is currently no urgent need to introduce
                    quantum-resistant encryption into Bitcoin's infrastructure.</p>

                <p>If the need were to arise, implementing quantum-resistant cryptography and forking the blockchain
                    would be a straightforward solution for Bitcoin. In fact, it is possible that someone has already
                    implemented this measure, although adoption of the new chain would likely occur only when there is a
                    tangible incentive, such as the emergence of a quantum computer capable of breaking the current
                    cryptography.</p>

                <p>There are claims suggesting that governments initiated Bitcoin as a centralized digital currency to
                    transition people away from cash. However, this argument does not hold up when considering the
                    decentralized nature of Bitcoin. Even if there were an attempt to introduce a backdoor or security
                    vulnerability, Bitcoin's open-source nature would enable the community to identify and rectify the
                    issue. Furthermore, even in the unlikely event that the government gained control over Bitcoin, the
                    Bitcoin community could simply patch the vulnerability, fork the chain, and continue using the
                    secure version. Therefore, any potential crisis could be swiftly resolved.</p>

                <p>So what about it losing 75% of its value? Doesn't that prove bitcoin is over? The broad consensus
                    among bitcoin chart analysts is that this price drop, or something close to it, was expected. While
                    the exact price point may not have been predicted due to the non-linear resistance line, the
                    occurrence of a bear market around this time was anticipated. Those who closely study bitcoin were
                    well aware of this possibility.</p>

                <p>To be fair, bitcoin did experience a significant dip below that resistance line, and it is important
                    to acknowledge that charting is more of an art than a science. This is not unique to bitcoin but
                    applies to all ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds). Bitcoin's current volatility stems from its predominant
                    use as a speculative asset rather than widespread adoption as a medium of exchange. However, it is
                    worth noting that speculation is not exclusive to bitcoin; volatile currencies and commodities are
                    also subject to speculation. A substantial price drop in oil, for example, does not imply the end of
                    oil as a valuable resource.</p>

                <p>A mass sell-off is unlikely to spell the demise of bitcoin because the majority of sellers are
                    motivated not by completely exiting bitcoin but by seizing the opportunity to re-enter the market at
                    a more favorable price. This behavior is common among speculators who exit positions as prices
                    decline, intending to buy back in when prices are lower, thereby driving the price back up. Engaging
                    in speculation does not imply a lack of belief in the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies.
                    Basic trend following analysis can yield significant profits with relatively minimal effort, so it
                    is not surprising that more people are involved in such activities. While debates with long-term
                    bitcoin holders (HODLers) persist, it is important to recognize that individuals have a personal
                    interest in playing the market to some extent, given their knowledge and capabilities, while still
                    maintaining their engagement with bitcoin. Many individuals primarily focus on bitcoin in their
                    trading endeavors.</p>

                <p>Although bitcoin has not yet achieved widespread usefulness as a form of money on a large scale, the
                    rise of authoritarianism increases the incentive to allocate value outside of government control,
                    and bitcoin presents itself as one of the viable options. As bitcoin's market cap increases, its
                    volatility is likely to decrease, making it more appealing for use as a medium of exchange. This, in
                    turn, will attract further investments aimed at enhancing its user-friendliness and expanding its
                    potential as a widely adopted currency.</p>

                <p>This aligns with Rothbard's historical understanding of the evolution of money. Money does not start
                    out as money; rather, commodities become money due to their commonality and wide acceptance.
                    Commodities become common because many people value them, and they evolve into money because they
                    function well as a medium of exchange. In the case of bitcoin, it has the characteristics of making
                    for good money, and people value it. The reasons behind why people value it may vary, but as it
                    gains wider acceptance, it will increasingly be used as a form of money. In fact, some countries
                    already embrace cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange.</p>

                <p>Gresham's law, a well-known principle, states that bad money tends to drive out good money. Due to
                    fiat currencies having an artificially determined (rather than market-set) and insecure value,
                    people are more inclined to spend fiat before spending bitcoin. They tend to save bitcoin with the
                    expectation that its value will likely increase in the future. This historical pattern has repeated
                    itself in various contexts. For example, when kings would debase currencies by diluting gold with a
                    cheap metal like tin and reminting the coins, individuals would distinguish between the pure and
                    debased coins, saving the more pure ones while using the debased coins for transactions. This
                    behavior emerged from market incentives rather than a coordinated decision. Similarly, when the
                    United States shifted to fiat currency, people began saving their gold and silver while spending the
                    fiat currency. This behavior stems from sound financial practices.</p>

                <p>The only reason bad money continues to circulate is due to legal requirements. If there were no legal
                    coercion to use bad money, it would quickly lose its value and become worthless. Therefore, for
                    bitcoin to be widely adopted as a currency, it would require a situation where there is no worse
                    money being mandated for circulation. In the meantime, bitcoin is likely to be used predominantly as
                    a form of savings, alongside other assets such as gold, food storage, and collectibles.</p>

                <p>Cryptocurrencies have a broader range of applications beyond serving as a currency. Even if bitcoin
                    never becomes a dominant medium of exchange, the technologies being developed in the crypto industry
                    are driving the next evolution of data and internet technologies. The industry is valued at
                    trillions of dollars, and the potential for innovation is far from being fully realized.
                    Cryptocurrencies are part of a larger set of technologies collectively referred to as Web3. While
                    the field is still evolving, and numerous ideas are being explored, the core principle behind these
                    technologies is openness. While proprietary players exist, the foundational technologies' code is
                    available for evaluation and can be modified using standard open-source consensus protocols.</p>

                <p>One of the key features of cryptocurrencies is their trustlessness. Users don't need to rely on a
                    third party to handle their data or honor agreements. When the algorithms and protocols are
                    accurately coded, they can execute with flawless logic. However, it is crucial to note that if there
                    are coding mistakes or exploitable bugs, the potential exists for significant losses. Fortunately,
                    AI auditing is making significant progress in identifying and addressing these issues more
                    effectively than human auditors.</p>

                <p>Cryptocurrencies are also characterized by their permissionlessness. No one's approval is required to
                    participate, and exclusion or censorship based on factors such as race, sexual preference, gender
                    identity, religion, or political preference is nearly impossible. Access and participation are open
                    to all.</p>

                <p>Many of these technologies share underlying fundamentals with cryptocurrencies, such as encryption,
                    digital signatures, hashes, distributed ledgers, peer-to-peer networking, consensus protocols, and
                    digital identity. These foundations have enabled the development of standardized, secure, and
                    open-source solutions, including smart contracts, decentralized computing and file storage, oracles,
                    currencies, and tokens.</p>

                <p>While there is currently a gold rush of short-term cash grabs and scams, with centralized startups
                    raising significant amounts of funding and occasionally absconding with the funds, these
                    technologies have the potential to foster greater and more competitive endeavors after the bubble
                    bursts. It is important to remember that even in perfectly free markets, bubbles can occur. Markets
                    are driven by human decision-making, and people can become enthralled and follow trends as a group.
                </p>

                <p>Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) can be built, functioning without a centralized
                    authority. When we say "no one is in charge," it does not mean there are no leaders or champions
                    propelling the organization forward. It means that these leaders do not possess unilateral authority
                    to make changes as they would in a traditional company or many governments. In fact, they are unable
                    to modify the code, as there are no secret passwords or closed-door meetings. It simply isn't
                    possible. The only way to influence the project is by acquiring a controlling stake, and if other
                    users disagree with the new direction, they can easily fork the project at minimal cost. Ultimately,
                    the market determines which version gains favor.</p>

                <p>There are various ways to structure a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), but in general,
                    they operate as follows. Participants "buy in" to the project, investing their resources and having
                    a stake in the organization. This mechanism, known as Proof-of-Stake, makes it costly to manipulate
                    or exploit the system for unfair advantage since one's investment is at risk.</p>

                <p>A governance protocol, often involving voting, is used to determine changes and decision-making
                    within the organization. This process can be likened to shareholders in a traditional company.</p>

                <p>Stakers, the participants who have invested in the DAO, vote on proposed features that should be
                    implemented. They may also vote to allocate compensation to individuals who will work on
                    implementing these features, or it may be a voluntary open-source project. The code undergoes
                    cross-checking, auditing, and implementation. Once the Stakers believe the code is ready, they vote
                    to implement it.</p>

                <p>If the organization generates profits, the voters determine the percentage of profits distributed,
                    much like receiving dividends in a cooperative or shareholder model. They have an incentive to
                    allocate some profits to the participants but avoid excessive amounts that could lead to bankruptcy.
                    The aim is to strike a balance that keeps the organization competitive and ensures the
                    sustainability of participants' investments.</p>

                <p>Cryptocurrencies have the potential to outcompete governments in the market, as they can address many
                    functions traditionally associated with governments more effectively in the long run. I believe it's
                    likely that cryptocurrencies will replace governments and provide market-based solutions for the
                    services governments claim to offer. However, this transformation will take time, and we are
                    currently in the early stages, comparable to the dot-com bubble.</p>

                <p>How would a DAO government function? Here's one example from a particular perspective: A person
                    purchases property in a city, and the square footage of the city entitles them to shares in the DAO,
                    representing their stake. They participate in voting on the governing principles of the city. A
                    flat-rate income tax is collected to fund infrastructure, expansion, enforcement, and dividends to
                    the stakeholders. It's important not to confuse this with the concept of "stakeholder capitalism"
                    that is currently being discussed; this approach is more akin to shareholders in a company.
                    Stakeholders are motivated to maintain low taxes to stimulate the city's economic growth, attract
                    immigration, and increase the number of stakeholders. However, taxes must be set at a level that
                    encourages further investment, funds additional infrastructure, and supports the city's expansion by
                    acquiring more land.</p>

                <p>While the previous explanation didn't delve into the technical aspects, smart contracts and
                    cryptocurrencies play a vital role in this system. The entire codebase is open source, and the
                    city's budget is recorded on the blockchain, enabling anyone to audit the expenditures.</p>

                <p>Smart contract code would be responsible for various functions, such as:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Property deeds: Immutable proof of a digital identity purchasing a specific parcel of land worth
                        a certain number of shares.</li>
                    <li>Permits: Verification of a digital identity having completed an approved driving class and being
                        authorized to operate a motorized vehicle in specific regions.</li>
                    <li>Employment: Confirmation that an employee has undergone specific training, demonstrated the
                        necessary skills, and is eligible for the corresponding pay, which is deposited into their
                        account.</li>
                    <li>Utilities: Reporting the meter readings for power usage, automatically paying the power bill,
                        and initiating the power supply.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>As the stakeholders are the citizens themselves, complaints are addressed through voting, and
                    solutions are determined through collective decision-making. Instead of encountering dismissal when
                    voicing concerns to utility companies or resorting to community-run social media platforms to gather
                    support for grievances, this system allows complaints to be raised and voted upon. When submitting a
                    complaint, individuals may find existing similar complaints to vote on, preventing the creation of
                    duplicate issues with no engagement. They can also provide their input in the comments section.</p>

                <p>If a complaint garners enough votes to indicate a high priority, either through increased
                    participation or the resolution of higher-ranked issues, proposed solutions are presented, voted
                    upon, and subsequently implemented.</p>

                <p>While some may envision this process as potentially leading to constant voting and the need to review
                    numerous complaints, the reality is quite the opposite. Current cities governed through traditional
                    means already face similar challenges, often resulting in unresolved issues for extended periods.
                    Frequently recurring problems can be addressed by reusing previously successful solutions and
                    automating and systematizing processes wherever feasible. This approach also incentivizes proactive
                    resolution of problems to minimize their frequency or eliminate them entirely.</p>

                <p>There will be individuals hired to handle most of these issues, and they will be motivated to perform
                    their duties to the best of their abilities within the allocated budget. Their aim would be to
                    minimize complaints and address problems promptly. For instance, a person assigned to fix potholes
                    on their block might simply be an individual equipped with a shovel and asphalt, using the allocated
                    budget to purchase materials and fill the potholes on weekends. They would engage with their
                    neighbors to ensure satisfaction. As long as no complaints arise, both parties would be content, and
                    the automated code aspect of the organization would not need to be invoked due to the successful
                    handling of the task.</p>

                <p>Bureaucratic bloat is a common issue that can arise when certain roles become obsolete or no longer
                    provide sufficient value for their compensation. Yearly independent audits and community tipping
                    mechanisms can help identify and address these flaws. Independent audits can detect inefficiencies,
                    while community tipping allows individuals to receive recognition and compensation for bringing
                    attention to problems or offering solutions. This incentivizes active participation and helps
                    maintain the efficiency and integrity of the system.</p>

                <p>The example presented in this discussion is intentionally structured to resemble a traditional city,
                    incorporating features that people typically expect. Just as the widespread adoption of on-screen
                    software keyboards on cellphones was unforeseen, predicting the specific features and forms of
                    governance that individuals would desire in a city can be challenging.</p>

                <p>What Web3 technology accomplishes is reducing bugs and corruption through inherent openness and
                    transparency. It operates in a trustless and permissionless manner, eliminating backroom deals and
                    embezzlement. Rules are explicitly consented to, and signatures are securely kept on the blockchain.
                </p>

                <p>This framework enables the design of various social structures and forms of governance, whether for
                    companies or governments, with complete visibility. It allows for genuine informed consent of those
                    being governed.</p>

                <p>When considering the broader scope of cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, gold-backed cryptos,
                    ethereum, or the multitude of private tokens traded by AI systems behind the scenes, it becomes
                    clear that debating which one is superior is akin to arguing between Windows and Mac.
                    Cryptocurrencies will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in the future of money and numerous other
                    applications.</p>

                <p>The future holds promising prospects, as the transformative power of cryptocurrencies and Web3
                    technologies continues to unfold. Thank you for reading this essay expressing my thoughts on
                    bitcoin, and I hope it has helped compensate for my previous lack of posts on the topic. Peace out!
